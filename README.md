## My process

### Built with

- React.js
- Tailwindcss
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles


### What I learned

I've been using HTML5, CSS3 and SCSS while they're great, I find Tailwindcss more iniututive as I see how a div/component was styled right on the line and no need to look back to the stylesheet.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) - This helped me understand how to customize theme for this project.
